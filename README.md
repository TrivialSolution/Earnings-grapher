## How to use

Simply enter in the stock ticker for any publicly traded company (case insensitive), and the page will generate a graph and table of the complete earnings history for that company.

## API use limit

Since the Alpha Vantage API free tier only allows three requests per minute per key, the site will not load new data if the user requests data too frequently or if multiple people request data simultaneously. 

To mitigate this, at the bottom of the webpage you can enter in your own Alpha Vantage API key, which you can generate for free on the [Alpha Vantage website](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key). The key is saved to your browser's cookies, so you do not have to enter it every time.
